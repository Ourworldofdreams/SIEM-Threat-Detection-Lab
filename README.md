### 2. Threat Simulation Scenarios

#### Reconnaissance Detection
- **Objective**: Validate detection of network mapping attempts
- **Implementation**: Executed controlled Nmap scans with varying profiles
```bash
# Network mapping simulation
nmap -sS -p- [target_ip] # SYN scan
nmap -sV -sC [target_ip] # Service version detection
```
