## **Lab Environment**  

| **Component**       | **Purpose**                                |  
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Elastic SIEM**     | Central platform for log collection and threat analysis. |  
| **Kali Linux**       | Simulated attack scenarios like Nmap scans. |  
| **Beats**            | Data shippers for forwarding logs to Elastic Stack. |

## **Process and Key Steps**  

### **1. Setting Up Elastic SIEM**  

Elastic SIEM, part of the Elastic Stack, provides powerful tools for detecting and analyzing threats in real time. I configured it to ingest logs and display them in an intuitive interface:  

- **Installed Components**:  
  - Elasticsearch: Log storage and indexing.  
  - Kibana: Visualization and SIEM dashboard.  

- **Key Configuration**:  
  - Installed and configured Filebeat to forward logs.  
  - Secured the environment with authentication.

### **2. Simulating Threats with Kali Linux**  

To test the SIEMâ€™s detection capabilities, I simulated network reconnaissance and attacks using Kali Linux:  

#### **Network Scanning (Nmap)**  
- **Objective**: Simulate an attacker identifying open ports and services.  
- **Commands**:

- **Outcome**: Elastic SIEM captured logs of the scanning activity.

**Why It Matters**: Early detection of reconnaissance can prevent full-scale cyberattacks.

### **3. Detecting and Analyzing Threats in Elastic SIEM**  

The logs from the Nmap scans were visualized and analyzed in Kibanaâ€™s SIEM dashboard. Highlights include:  

- Detailed records of IP activity, port scans, and service discovery.  
- Real-time visualizations that help prioritize security alerts.
